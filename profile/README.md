## Hi there üëã Welcome to:

#   [Talckatoo](https://talckatoo.github.io/promo_talckatoo/) - Chat App 

Why did we pick this idea to work on and what's Talckatoo's purpose?
- We couldn't find any real chat app that allows seamless communication with individuals who don't speak the same language.
If we want to communicate with someone who doesn't understand our language, we both have to go through the tedious process of copying and pasting messages into an external translation tool like Google Translate. Additionally, sending voice notes to someone who doesn't understand your language is nearly impossible.
- We have personally encountered these challenges and observed others grappling with them too. In addition to our personal experiences, we conducted a small survey, and everyone we spoke to confirmed that they had faced this issue at some point in their lives.
We are all first-time learners in this field, but we've demonstrated our ability to learn quickly and make significant progress in just 2 months.
- Talckatoo's mission is to eliminate these language barriers. Talckatoo delivers seamless real-time language translation and transcription right within your chat interface. It empowers users to effortlessly connect with individuals who speak diverse languages, as our innovative technology automatically translates text or voice messages from the sender into the recipient's preferred language.

Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?
- Our primary competitors include iMessage, Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, iTranslate, SayHi Translate, and Papago. While these platforms offer real-time translation capabilities and chat applications, none of them offer the level of convenience that Talckatoo provides within a chat environment.
- What sets Talckatoo apart from its competitors is its seamless integration of real-time text-to-text and voice-to-voice translation directly into chat conversations. This unique feature allows users to engage in chat, send voice notes, and exchange messages without the need to know each other's language.
- Talckatoo's exclusive focus on in-chat translation distinguishes us from the competition, offering unmatched convenience and fostering global connections without language barriers.
